# POIC - Planar Objects Tracking with Illumination Changes

The dataset published in paper "Robust Visual Tracking for Planar Objects Using Gradient Orientation Pyramid"

Previous [paper](http://www.dabi.temple.edu/~hbling/publication/17esm-go.pdf) and [code](http://www.dabi.temple.edu/~hbling/code/ICRA17_GO-ESM_release.zip) in ICRA'17.

## Sequences
POIC dataset contains total `20` sequence which in folder `./sequences`, and we also show the templates of all the 20 sequence which in floader `./Templates`

## Ground truth
The ground truth files are in folder `./gt`

## Results
We provide all results of the methods referenced in our paper in folder `./results`.
